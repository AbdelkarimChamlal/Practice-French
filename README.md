#French practice .<br>
the project is an android project.<br>
meant to help people start learning french .<br>
what the app does is making sure you don't forget the most used words and practice them daily.<br>
and since french have a hard conjugation rules .<br>
and most of the verbs that are often used don't follow any rules and just need to be remembered .<br>
and the only way to reach that is by praticing them.<br>
